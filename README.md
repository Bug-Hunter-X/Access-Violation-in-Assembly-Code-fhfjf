This repository contains an example of an uncommon code error in assembly language: an access violation caused by an attempt to read from an invalid memory address.  The `bug.asm` file demonstrates the faulty code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from the lack of sufficient bounds checking before accessing memory pointed to by ebx+4.  This could happen if ebx is improperly initialized or modified during program execution. The solution emphasizes the importance of proper memory management and validation in assembly programming.
